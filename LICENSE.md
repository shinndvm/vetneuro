Children
The Application is not used to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.

The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The Service Provider encourages all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. The Service Provider encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission.

Your Consent
By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by the Service Provider. This application is designed exclusively as an adjunctive educational and clinical support tool for licensed veterinary professionals. By using this application, you acknowledge and agree to the following:
•	For Veterinary Professionals: This application is intended to assist, not replace, your professional veterinary judgment. The neurolocalization algorithms and suggestions provided by this app are based on standard veterinary literature but do not constitute a final diagnosis. As the attending veterinarian, you are solely responsible for performing the physical and neurological examination, interpreting clinical signs, and determining the final neurolocalization, diagnosis, and treatment plan.
•	For Veterinary Technicians, Students, and Pet Owners: While this application may be used for educational purposes or data entry assistance, it is not a diagnostic tool for laypersons. Accurate neurolocalization relies entirely on a neurological examination performed by a trained professional. Without professional veterinary training, clinical signs may be misinterpreted, leading to inaccurate results within the app. Do not use this application to diagnose or treat any animal without consulting a licensed veterinarian.
•	No Warranty: While we strive for accuracy, veterinary medicine is a complex and evolving field. The developers make no warranties regarding the completeness or accuracy of the content and assume no liability for any clinical decisions made based on this application.
